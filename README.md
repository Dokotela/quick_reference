## Style Guide

Follow the [Dart style guide].

Of note, you should:

- Use `UpperCamelCase` for types.
- Use `lowercase_snake_case` for libraries, packages, directories, and files.
- Use `lowerCamelCase` for constant names.
- Use `lowerCamelCase` for everything else (like variable names).
- Capitalize acronyms and abbreviations longer than two letters (Http rather than HTTP or http).
- A leading underscore makes a member variable private. Only use it if it is private.
- You can use single line if statements for returns.
- Use `///` instead of `/** */` for multi-line comments.

For VS Code, install the Dart and Flutter plugin. Set your editor to [format on save].

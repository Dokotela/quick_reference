Well baby >34 weeks gestation and/or >1500 g: • LBW infants who are able to breastfeed should be put to the breast as soon as possible after birth when they are clinically stable. • Feed on demand, at least every 3 hours (at least 8 feeds per day).

Expressed breast milk should be obtained and given to infant by cup, spoon or oral/nasal-gastric tube. Bottle feed not recommended. • Feed EBM every 2 hours (12 feeds per day). May put to breast after EBM. • Neonates unable to BF should be kept NPO for day 1. On day 2 start EBM at 10ml/kg/day, with the remaining fluid requirement met by intravenous fluids. • Increase EBM by 30ml/kg/day every 24 hours and decrease IV fluids to keep within daily fluid requirement until IVF stopped. Monitor carefully for feeding intolerance (vomiting, apnea, gastric residuals). • When enteral feeding volume reaches 100ml/kg/day and baby tolerating enteral feeds, the IV infusion may be stopped. Aim to stop IVF by day 7-8 of life to reduce risk of infection. • Newborns lose weight the first week of life but should not lose more than 10% body weight. • Newborns should be back to birthweight by 2 weeks of age. After infant regains BW, the goal is to gain 20-30 grams a day during the first 6-8 weeks of life Indications for OGT or NGT: • All neonates <1300 grams until gaining weight steadily. • Premature or VLBW (<32-34 wks or <1500 g) with poor suck, ineffective suck/swallow coordination (coughs or vomits with feed), fatigues easily. • Respiratory distress –risk aspiration.

    "87": " Neonatal Jaundice • Assess for jaundice in bright, natural light if possible. Check eyes, under tongue, palms and soles • Always measure serum bilirubin if <24 hours and if clinically moderate or severe jaundice. Treat according to https://bilitool.org/ or infant age in days per WHO guidelines below • Any jaundice <24 hours needs further evaluation and urgent treatment with phototherapy or exchange transfusion • If unable to measure bilirubin start phototherapy: • In well baby with jaundice easily visible sole of foot during first week of life • In a preterm baby (<2000 gm) with ANY visible jaundice • In a sick baby with poor feeding, irritability and moderate to severe jaundice. Evaluate and treat for sepsis • Babies over 2 weeks of age need evaluation for obstructive causes of jaundice such as biliary atresia. They do not usually require phototherapy. • Phototherapy will not treat indirect hyperbilirubinemia Phototherapy and Supportive Care: Checklist • Shield the eyes with eye patch or hat. Remove periodically during feeds • Keep the baby naked • Place the baby close to the light source – 45 cm distance is often recommended but closer OK if baby not overheating. May use white cloth around light to reflect light back to bay. Learn recommended distance for your equipment • Do not place anything on phototherapy devices. Lights and baby need to keep cool so do not block air vents. Also keep device clean – dust can carry bacteria and reduce light emitted • Promote frequent breastfeeding. Unless baby dehydrated, supplements or IV fluids are unnecessary. Phototherapy can be interrupted for feeds and to allow maternal bonding • Periodically change position from supine to prone. Expose the maximum surface area of baby. Reposition after each feed • Monitor temperature every 2 hours and weight every 24 hours • Periodic (12-24 hours) plasma/serum bilirubin test required. Visual testing for jaundice is unreliable • Make sure light source is working and emitting light. Fluorescent tubes should be replaced if more than 6 months in use, tube ends have blackened or lights flicker. 87",
